This project was developed using Unity software, for the interaction and experience in an apocalyptic environment with the intervention of zombies and other actors that threaten the player's life, where each level is forced to move through hostile territories having to Fight zombies of different classes or categories until you enter a safe area where you will not receive damage from the toxic atmosphere.

To create the application, it was necessary to use different graphic design tools to give life and animation to the characters that intervene in each scene, in addition to the implementation of logic for each object in it, such as the controllers for both the user and the the enemies in question, the generation of these throughout each map, mobility controllers and user gameplay in interaction with the computer-generated environment.

Each scenario has a safe zone, generated randomly for each map in question and increasingly reduced by increasing difficulty after a certain time managed by internal settings in its programming logic.
